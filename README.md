Udacity -> Blockchain-> Blockchain fundamental cource project

Project Introduction
You are starting your journey as a Blockchain Developer. This project allows you to demonstrate that you are familiarized with the fundamental concepts of a Blockchain platform. Concepts like:

- Block
- Blockchain
- Wallet
- Blockchain Identity
- Proof of Existence
- Digital Assets
Are some of the most important components in the Blockchain Framework that you will need to describe and also, why not? Implement too.

In this project you will have a boilerplate code with a REST Api already setup to expose some of the functionalities you will implement in your private blockchain.
